Finger deformations have posed a challenge in the effective recognition of finger veins but can be effectively used in determining a genuine or impostor match in finger biometrics. We tackle this 
issue in our study by using a set of five different types of finger deformations and a neural network approach to validate if the input image of a finger with the finger 
vein data belongs to the match in the system, or is an attack attempt.
