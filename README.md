Finger deformations have posed a challenge in the effective recognition of finger veins but can be effectively used in determining a genuine or impostor match in finger biometrics. We tackle this 
issue in our study by using a set of five different types of finger deformations and a neural network (VGG16) Keras approach to validate if the input image of a finger belongs to the finger 
vein data in the system, or is a spoof attack attempt.
